# Analysis of Driven Damped Pendulums and their Chaotic Motion
This repository contains my final project for AMATH 271, An Introduction to Theoretical Mechanics.

In this paper we present an analysis of the equations governing the motion of a driven damped pendulum (DDP). A DDP is a pendulum with an element of damping (a loss in the overall energy of the system, often due to air resistance or other dissipative forces) and a sinusoidal driving force (this allows the system to continue its motion.) Not only does this system have non-linear equations of motion, but it is known to exhibit chaotic behaviour for certain parameters, meaning that its motion is not fully predictable. Chaotic systems are highly sensitive to initial conditions, and can produce entirely different results with only small differences. We will discuss techniques used to illustrate chaotic motion with the use of computer simulations, while introducing terminology and graphical representations, such as bifurcation diagrams, state space orbits and time-series plots.

In Summary, this report analyzes an oscillatory system that continues to receive and lose energy with more-or-less random behavior that is highly sensitive to initial parameters.
